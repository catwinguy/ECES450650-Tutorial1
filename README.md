# Tutorial 1: Muscle Alignment vs MAFFT Alignment

This repo will consist of a tutorial going through how align the H. Influenzae 16S gene using [Cipres](http://www.phylo.org/). The two alignment techniques used will be Muscle Alignment and MAFFT Alignment.

Our explanation slide going through both of these techniques can be found in our [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17b1fmlNiDsnRNl6CX-3vmXKynmYSaxxbqQ1F7KIsx-Q/edit#slide=id.g124f8f2f274_1_60).
